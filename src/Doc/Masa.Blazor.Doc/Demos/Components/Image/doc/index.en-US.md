The `MImage` component is packed with features to support rich media.

## API

- [MImage](/api/MImage)

## Caveats

<!--alert:info--> 
The MImage component uses the Intersect directive which requires a Polyfill for IE11 and Safari. If a browser that does not support this functionality is detected, the image will still load as normal.
