## Examples

### Props

#### Confirm

Provides a standard type of confirmation dialog.

<example file="" />

#### PageHeader

A more general header, including title, subtitle, action buttons and search bar.

<example file="" />

#### Sidebar

Because the components of **MList**, **MListGroup**, **MListItem** and **MListItemGroup** are loosely connected, it is impossible to achieve the effect of **MListGroup** automatic expansion by a given value. So made a component like this.
