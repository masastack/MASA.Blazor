## Examples

### Props

#### Boilerplate component

The MSkeletonLoader can be used as boilerplate designs when creating mockups. Mix and match various pre-defined options or create your own unique implementations. In this example, we use a custom data property to apply the same props to multiple MSkeletonLoader's at once.
