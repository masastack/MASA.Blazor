title: Expansion panels
desc: "The **MExpansionPanel** component is useful for reducing vertical space with large amounts of information. The default
functionality of the component is to only display one expansion-panel body at a time; however, with the **Multiple**
property, the expansion-panel can remain open until explicitly closed."

### Misc

#### Advanced

The expansion panel component provides a rich playground to build truly advanced implementations. Here we take advantage of slots in the **MExpansionPanelHeader**   component to react to the state of being open or closed by fading content in and out.
