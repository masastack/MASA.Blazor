## Usage

By default, the `ListItemGroup` operates similarly to **ItemGroup**. If a `Value` is not provided, the group will provide a default based upon its index.

## Examples

### Props

#### ActiveClass

You can select multiple items at one time.

<example file="" />

#### Mandatory

At least one item must be selected to use the `Multiple` property.

<example file="" />

#### Multiple

Using the `Multiple` property you can select multiple items at once.

<example file="" />

### Misc

#### Flat list

You can easily disable the default highlighting of selected **MListItem**s. This creates a lower profile for a userâ€™s choices.

<example file="" />

#### Selection controls

Using the default slot, you can access an items internal state and toggle it. Since the `Active` property is a boolean, we use the `IsActive` prop on the checkbox to link its state to the **MListItem**.
