desc: "The `MErrorHandler` component is used to handle exception information when the `blazor` component data is loaded and rendered."

## Usage

### Exception unified handling:

1.Exceptions in the life cycle of balzor cannot be handled, and are directly passed to ErrorBoundry for processing;
2.Exceptions generated by non-MASA Blazor components cannot be handled and are directly passed to ErrorBoundry for processing;
3.Exceptions generated by non-lifecycle methods of MASA Blazor components can be handled. By default, Exception.Message is displayed. 
You can also configure other options to display exception stack or customize exception handling.

## Examples

### Props

#### OnErrorHandleAsync

Custom exception handling `Func<Exception, Task >`, after clicking the button triggers the exception, 
the button background color changes to red and the text color changes to white.

<example file="" />

#### ShowAlert

`true` displays the error message and retains the content of the form currently filled in, 
`false` does not display the error, and passes the exception up to ErrorBoundry to handle the error; 
If an error occurs during the life cycle loading process, whether the current razor is included in the upper-level Error handler:

1.If included, the exception will be displayed first, and the current page content will be rendered as the default ErrorBoundry error handling content;

2.Not included, the direct content of the current page is rendered as the default ErrorBoundry error handling content;

<example file="" />

#### ShowDetail

`true` is displayed, `false` is not displayed, and the default is not displayed.

<example file="" />
