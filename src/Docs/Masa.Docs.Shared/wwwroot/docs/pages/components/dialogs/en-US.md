## Usage

A dialog contains two slots, one for its activator and one for its content (default). Good for Privacy Policies.

## Examples

### Props

#### Fullscreen

Due to limited space, full-screen dialogs may be more appropriate for mobile devices than dialogs used on devices with larger screens.

#### Transitions

You can make the dialog appear from the top or the bottom.

<example file="" />

#### Persistent

Similar to a Simple Dialog, except that itâ€™s not dismissed when touching outside or pressing esc key.

#### Scrollable

#### Nesting

Dialogs can be nested: you can open one dialog from another.

#### Overflowed

Modals that do not fit within the available window space will scroll the container.

#### Without activator

If for some reason you are unable to use the activator slot, be sure to add the `StopPropagation` modifier to the event that triggers the dialog.
