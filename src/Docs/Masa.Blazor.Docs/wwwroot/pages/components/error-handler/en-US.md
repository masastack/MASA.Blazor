desc: "The `MErrorHandler` component is used to handle exception information when the `blazor` component data is loaded and rendered."

## Usage

### Exception unified handling:

1.Exceptions in the life cycle of balzor cannot be handled, and are directly passed to ErrorBoundry for processing;
2.Exceptions generated by non-MASA Blazor components cannot be handled and are directly passed to ErrorBoundry for processing;
3.Exceptions generated by non-lifecycle methods of MASA Blazor components can be handled. By default, Exception.Message is displayed. 
You can also configure other options to display exception stack or customize exception handling.

## Examples

### Props

#### OnErrorHandleAsync

Custom exception handling `Func<Exception, Task<bool>>`, after clicking the button triggers the exception, the button background color changes to red and the text color changes to white.
If the return value is `True`, the exception information will not be displayed, and the exception will be handled directly. It is recommended that after implementing custom exception handling, the exception information will be temporarily reset by itself, and the return value will be set to `True`;
The return value is: `False`, the exception information will be prompted first, and then the exception will be handled.

#### ShowAlert

`true` displays the error message and retains the content of the form currently filled in, 
`false` does not display the error, and passes the exception up to ErrorBoundry to handle the error; 
If an error occurs during the life cycle loading process, whether the current razor is included in the upper-level Error handler:

1.If included, the exception will be displayed first, and the current page content will be rendered as the default ErrorBoundry error handling content;

2.Not included, the direct content of the current page is rendered as the default ErrorBoundry error handling content;
