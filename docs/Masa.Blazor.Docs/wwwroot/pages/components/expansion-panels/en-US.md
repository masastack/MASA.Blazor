title: Expansion panels
desc: "The **MExpansionPanel** component is useful for reducing vertical space with large amounts of information. The default functionality of the component is to only display one expansion-panel body at a time; however, with the **Multiple** property, the expansion-panel can remain open until explicitly closed."

## Usage

Expansion panels in their simplest form display a list of expandable items.

## Examples

### Props

#### Accordion

`Accordion` expansion-panel hasnâ€™t got margins around active panel.

<masa-example file="Examples.components.expansion_panels.Accordion"></masa-example>

#### Disabled

ExpansionPanels Both the extension panel and its content can be `disabled` using the disabled attribute. 

<masa-example file="Examples.components.expansion_panels.Disabled"></masa-example>

#### Focusable

Expansion panel headers can be made focusable using the `focusable` property.

<masa-example file="Examples.components.expansion_panels.Focusable"></masa-example>

#### Inset

When the `inset` property is activated, the current expansion panel becomes smaller.

<masa-example file="Examples.components.expansion_panels.Inset"></masa-example>

#### Model

The extension panel can be controlled externally by modifying `@bind-Values`. Its value corresponds to the currently open expansion panel index (0-based). If the `multiple` attribute is used, an array containing the indices of the open items.

#### Popout

The expansion panel also has a popout design. If the expansion panel activates the `popout` property, the expansion panel will expand when activated.

#### Readonly

The `readonly` attribute does the same thing as disabled , but without styling.

<masa-example file="Examples.components.expansion_panels.Readonly"></masa-example>

#### Subcomponent props {released-on=v1.6.0}

<masa-example file="Examples.components.expansion_panels.SubComponents"></masa-example>

### Misc

#### Advanced

The expansion panel component provides a rich playground to build truly advanced implementations. Here we take advantage of slots in the **MExpansionPanelHeader**   component to react to the state of being open or closed by fading content in and out.

#### Custom icon

Expand action icon can be customized with `ExpandIcon` prop or the **ActionsContent**.
