## Anatomy

## SubComponents

#### MCardActions

#### MCardSubtitle

Provide default **font size** and **fill** for card subtitles. Font size can be overwritten with [typesetting] (/stylesandimages/text-and-typography).

#### MCardText

It is mainly used for **text content** in cards. Apply padding to the text and reduce its font size to. 875rem.

#### MCardTitle

Provide default font size and padding for card subtitles. Font size can be overwritten with [typesetting] (/stylesandimages/text-and-typography).
