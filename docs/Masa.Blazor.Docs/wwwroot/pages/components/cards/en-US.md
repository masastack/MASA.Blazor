<cards-usage></cards-usage>

## Anatomy

The recommended placement of elements inside of `MCard` is:

* Place `MCardTitle`, `MCardSubtitle` or other title text on top
* Place `MCardText` and other forms of media below the card header
* Place `MCardActions` after card content

| Element / Area | Description |
| - | - |
| 1. Container | The Card container holds all `MCard` components. Composed of 3 major parts: `MCardItem`, `MCardText`, and `MCardActions` |
| 2. Title (optional) | A heading with increased **font-size** |
| 3. Subtitle (optional) | A subheading with a lower emphasis text color |
| 4. Text (optional) | A content area with a lower emphasis text color |
| 5. Actions (optional) | A content area that typically contains one or more [MButton](blazor/components/buttons) components |

## SubComponents

#### MCardActions

A container used to place actions for cards, such as [MButton] (/components/buttons) or [MMenu] (/components/menu). Use a special margin on the button at the same time
So that they match other card content areas.

#### MCardSubtitle

Provide default **font size** and **fill** for card subtitles. Font size can be overwritten with [typesetting] (/stylesandimages/text-and-typography).

#### MCardText

Primarily used for **text content** in a card. Applies padding for text, reduces its font-size to .875rem.

#### MCardTitle

Provide default **font size** and **padding** for card subtitles. Font size can be overwritten with [typesetting] (/stylesandimages/text-and-typography).

## Examples

### Props

#### Loading

Cards can be set to a loading state when processing a user action. This disables further actions and provides visual feedback with an indeterminate  [MProgressLinear](/blazor/components/progress-linear)

#### Outlined

An outlined card has 0 elevation and contains a soft border.

### Misc

#### Card Reveal

Using [ExpandTransition](/blazor/styles-and-animations/transitions) and a @click event you can have a card that reveals more information once the button is clicked, activating the hidden card to be revealed.

#### Grids

Using grids, you can create beautiful layouts.

#### Horizontal cards

Using **MCol** , you can create customized horizontal cards. Use the contain property to shrink the MImage to fit inside the container, instead of covering.

#### Information card

Cards are entry points to more detailed information. To keep things concise, ensure to limit the number of actions the user can take.

#### Twitter card

The **MCard** component has multiple children components that help you build complex examples without having to worry about spacing. This example is comprised of the **MCardTitle**, **MCardText** and **MCardActions** components.

#### Weather card

Using [MListItems](/blazor/components/lists) and a [MSlider](/blazor/components/sliders), we are able to create a unique weather card. The list components ensure that we have consistent spacing and functionality while the slider component allows us to provide a useful interface of selection to the user.

#### Loading

Use an indeterminate [MProgressLinear](/blazor/components/progress-linear) to indicate a loading state.
