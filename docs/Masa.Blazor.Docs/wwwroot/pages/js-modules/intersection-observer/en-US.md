# Intersection observer

The **IntersectJSModule** utilizes the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). It provides an easy-to-use interface for detecting when elements are visible within the user’s viewport. This is also used for the [MLazy](/blazor/labs/lazy) component.

## Usage

Scroll the window and watch the colored dot. Notice as the [MCard](/blazor/components/cards) comes into view that it changes from error to success.
